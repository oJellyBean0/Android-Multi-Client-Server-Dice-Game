# Multi-Client-Server-Dice-Game

This slightly modified question is also from a previous exam.

You are required to write a set of Client-Server applications that allows two people to roll and move their own
sets of dice within the same area.

You are required to write an Android version of the client application.

The application must function in the following manner:

```
 When the application starts, the user clicks on the “Connect to Server” button. Doing so will
connect their application to the server application and will pair them to the next client to log on.
 Once a connection has been established between a pair of clients, the “Add Die” button becomes
enabled (or simply a “+” button will do). Clicking on the button will add a die to the person’s dice
area in a random location and with a random number (between 1 and 6 included).
 A person’s own dice appear in a light shade of blue and the other person’s dice appear a light
shade of green (or some other visually distinct manner, such as different looking dice).
 A person may roll a die (by clicking on it) or move it (by dragging it), but may not roll or move the
other person’s dice.
 If one person adds a new die or moves or rolls their own dice, the other person will immediately
see what they are doing on their application.
 The positions and values of all dice must be exactly the same in both applications! The only
difference will be the colours of the dice, i.e. the user’s own dice will appear tinted blue, while
the other user’s will appear tinted green.
